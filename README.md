# Python for ML Learning Repository

This repository contains **clean, structured, and finalized work** from my learning journey in **Machine Learning and GenAI**.

## Main Branch
- Polished notebooks and examples
- Concepts refined from learning branches
- Clear, reproducible code and explanations

## Supporting Branches
- `statistics-for-ml` → statistics, EDA, feature scaling, outliers  
- `python-libraries&framework` → NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, TensorFlow, scikit-learn, OOP, important functions  

## Focus Areas
- Python for ML & GenAI  
- Data understanding and preprocessing  
- Model-related intuition and evaluation  

## Note
Learning and experimentation happen in branches. Only refined content is merged into `main`.
