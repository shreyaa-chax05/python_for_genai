# Python for Generative AI 🚀

This repository contains my structured learning of **Python foundations required for Machine Learning and Generative AI**.  
The focus is on **practical usage, clean workflows, and statistical intuition** commonly used in real ML/GenAI codebases.

The learning order is intentional and mirrors how Python is applied in industry rather than taught academically.
