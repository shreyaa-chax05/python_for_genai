# Statistics for Machine Learning 📊🤖

This branch contains my structured learning and practice of **Statistics concepts essential for Machine Learning and GenAI**.  
The focus is on building **strong intuition + practical understanding** rather than just formulas.

---

## 🎯 Objective
- Understand core statistical concepts used in ML models
- Connect theory with real ML use-cases
- Build intuition for data analysis, modeling, and evaluation

---

## 📚 Topics Covered (and ongoing)

- Descriptive Statistics  
  - Mean, Median, Mode  
  - Variance & Standard Deviation  

- Probability Basics  
  - Random variables  
  - Conditional probability  
  - Bayes’ Theorem  

- Probability Distributions  
  - Normal, Binomial, Poisson  
  - Real-world interpretation  

- Statistical Inference  
  - Sampling  
  - Confidence Intervals  
  - Hypothesis Testing  

- Correlation & Covariance  

- Multivariate Statistics  
  - Feature relationships  
  - Intro to dimensionality reduction  

- Statistics used in ML  
  - Loss functions intuition  
  - Bias–Variance tradeoff  
  - Evaluation metrics interpretation  

---

## 🛠 Tools & Libraries
- Python
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

---

## 📂 Branch Context
- This is a **learning & practice branch**
- Notebooks may be exploratory and iterative
- Cleaned and finalized content will be merged into `main`

---

## 🚀 Learning Approach
- Concept → intuition → small experiments
- Visualizations wherever possible
- Notes written from an ML perspective

---

## 📌 Note
This branch will be updated continuously as I progress deeper into  
Machine Learning and GenAI.
